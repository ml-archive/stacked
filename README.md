## üì¶ Installation

### Installing CStack

For Stacked to work, you first need to install the [CStack](https://github.com/nodes-vapor/cstack) library on the machine that is going to run your project. Please remember to do this on any machine you might deploy your project to:

#### macOS and Homebrew

First add the tap:

```
brew tap nodes-vapor/homebrew-tap
```

And next, install the library by running:

```
brew install cstack
```

#### Linux and APT

We're working hard on making CStack available on Linux (through APT) and we'll make sure to update this readme as soon as it gets ready.

### Integrating `Stacked` in your project

Update your `Package.swift` file.
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/stacked.git", majorVersion: 0)
```


## Getting started üöÄ

First remember to import the module:
```swift
import Stacked
```

Second, call `getStackTrace` to get a stacktrace that works on both Mac and Linux:
```swift
FrameAddress.getStackTrace(maxStackSize: 100)
```

Which will return you the stacktrace as a `[String]`.
